# FOMAC-Autoformer-for-Dengue-Incidence
FOMaC-Autoformer is a hybrid time-series forecasting model that integrates a First-Order Markov Chain with the Autoformer architecture to capture both stochastic state transitions and long-term temporal patterns. It improves robustness and interpretability in highly variable data such as dengue incidence forecasting.
