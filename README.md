# FOMAC-Autoformer-for-Dengue-Incidence
FOMaC-Autoformer is a hybrid time-series forecasting model that integrates a First-Order Markov Chain with the Autoformer architecture to capture both stochastic state transitions and long-term temporal patterns. It improves robustness and interpretability in highly variable data such as dengue incidence forecasting.

## Project Information

This repository contains the implementation associated with the
undergraduate thesis of DS-34 (2025–2026).

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the Autoformer time-series forecasting framework
proposed by Wu et al. The official implementation is available at:

We acknowledge the authors for making their work publicly accessible
for research and educational purposes.

## Usage Notice

This repository is publicly available for academic viewing only.
The code, models, and experimental results are part of an undergraduate
thesis and may not be copied, modified, or redistributed without
explicit permission from all authors.

## Data Sources

Meteorological data used in this study were obtained from the
Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).

Dengue incidence data were sourced from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle.

All data remain the property of their respective providers and were used
solely for academic and research purposes. Any restrictions or conditions
imposed by the data providers are fully respected.
